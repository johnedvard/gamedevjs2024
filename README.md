## Puckit!

A game made in 2 weeks for the annual [Gamedev.js](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/) gamejam 2024.
The theme is, `Power`, and in this game, you power up your power puck to plunge the pewny pawns into the pits. I call it _Puckit!_

Everything is made by me, including code, graphics, animations, and sound effects. The background music is not made entirely by me, as I took an existing track and made a remix of it.

## How to play

- Drag finger or mouse to send your puck towards the enemy puck
- Charge your battery by sending electrified pucks in the holes
- Unleash a devestating power blow by tapping the charged battery, destroying all enemies within proximity
- Score as many points as you can before you spend all your shots or reach the end of the stage
