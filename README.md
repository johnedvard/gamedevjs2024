## Puckit!

A game made in 2 weeks for the annual [Gamedev.js](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/) gamejam 2024.
The theme is, `Power`, and in this game, you power up your puck to plunge the puny pawns into the pits. I call it _Puckit!_

Play the game here: https://reitgames.itch.io/puckit

Everything is made by me, including code, graphics, animations, and sound effects. The background music is not made entirely by me, as I took an existing track and made a remix of it.

## How to play

- Drag finger or mouse to send your puck towards the enemy puck
- Charge your battery by putting enemies in the holes
- Unleash a devastating power blow by tapping the charged battery, destroying all enemies within proximity
- Score as many points as you can before you spend all your shots or fall in a hole yourself

## Challenges

- Open Source
- Made with Phaser

## Post Jam

I have worked more on this game since the jam ended, and you can play the post jam version here
